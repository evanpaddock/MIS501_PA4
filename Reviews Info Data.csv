Well ... that didn't happen, despite having this set up in my garage for the past few weeks. I know there are mice in there because I can hear them. They must be laughing together over a few beers at the Hole in the Wall Bar at how ridiculous this baiter is.The trap itself is pretty much a no-brainer. You paste your peanut butter onto the plate, make sure all the doors are shut tight, and put it near a spot mice frequent (like right outside that Hole in the Wall Bar). If you think the bait has gotten a bit old, you can just wash it out under the faucet and paste some new stuff on.One plus on this trap is that the springs are all inside the trap, so it seems safe enough to leave around pets. Another plus is that there are no chemicals involved, and it definitely looks like it will kill quickly. Our mice seem to be smarter than the average critters, so perhaps we should just swap out the peanut butter for a smear of Guinness froth and catch some leprechauns instead.There is a 30 day warranty with this thing, and you're supposed to see the most mice caught on day 1, so even if this trap disappoints you as much as it did me, you can still get your money back.",2.0,Haven't caught those critters yet,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",5,2013,264,30,trap,ineffective,trap,ineffective

This means you get a lot of field mice and they like to climb into vehicles and nest.

This particular one, the ""Large 64 inch"" grill cover, is clearly intended for Weber's line of gas grills.  It's really tough to know which grill cover goes with which grill.  After reading a few Amazon reviews, I bought the Large 64-inch to cover my new Weber Summit 470.  The prior reviews were correct: the cover fits perfectly in terms of shape, width, and depth.  However, in terms of height, it is about 6 inches too short to touch the ground.  That makes it tough - not impossible - to slip the hold-fast straps around the caster wheels; and it means that low spray (as from a lawn sprinkler, or a large amount of rain runoff) will be hitting your grill instead of the cover.  On the other hand, that means that air will be circulating in your grill's bottom compartment, where things like the drip pan live, and if you live in a mild climate that's probably a good thing.  When the covered grill gets rained on, the grill won't get wet, unless we're talking about a torrential downpour and gale-force winds; in which case, you'll want the deeper, XL-sized cover to prevent moisture entry in the bottom cabinet.The cover itself is made of a sturdy canvas-like cloth, quite tough, properly vented with rainproof vents, doesn't leak water, and is well fitted.  It has two handles, four holdfast straps to go around the casters, and the hem has an elastic drawstring.  It's easy to get on and off the grill even if you're doing it alone.  There is even a zippered pocket that goes across the top, although it's not clear to me what you'd want to keep in there - I don't use it.I'd buy this cover again, but I live in a very moderate climate in California.

Do they work? Does it attract hummingbirds? Yes this one does.I really like the large reservoir, a full 24 oz capacity, making the juice last a long time. No funnel needed to fill this top-loading, wide-mouth, hummingbird feeder. The lid screws on and off with ease and has a dip in the lid forming a rainwater catching ring to keep ants from climbing down the hanging wire and stopping up the feeder holes. Even comes with a metal s-hook for hanging.My one dislike is the fact that the reservoir is made of glass. It's strong glass, but if dropped it will break. Of course if a plastic one is dropped while loaded, it will likely break as well.The base also separates easily for cleaning when needed. As long as the ants do not get inside, the feeder can be refilled a few times without cleaning, I have found. Perches below the white and pink plastic blossoms containing the feeder holes are enjoyed by the hummers.

Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","The theory behind these traps is that a dead mouse - killed by means other than the ""Kill & Seal"" disposable trap - could let loose parasites and germs that might move on to our pets or our children and that dead mouse urine or blood could trigger asthma reactions. Enter (not literally) ""Kill & Seal"" where mice come in because they smell the bait (not included) inside and are quickly killed, out of sight and sealed in so that nothing, not even germs or little parasites can get out. The trap and its victim can then be safely and hygienically disposed and a new trap can be set to catch the next mouse candidate.Operation is easy. There is a corked opening through which 'bait' is dropped into the trap. Pulling a lever will set the trap and open the door. After the mouse enters to investigate the door closes shut and the mouse is smashed dead but we don't see that unless we remove the cork through which we inserted the bait. It should be practically impossible or very difficult to reuse these traps once a mouse is caught and attempting to do so would defeat the trap's purpose of preventing germs and parasites from jumping on us.While these traps appear to be effective - one of them caught what was probably the last uncaught mouse left in our basement - they are expensive too.

It also feels heavier than most String trimmer/edger because of these unwanted vibrations.While it may be conceptually a good idea as it does not need string replacement but it has a major design flaw as the motor is severely underpowered and gets compounded by the semi stiff space age plastic blade whenever it comes in contact with cutting materials like grass or weeds.IMHO, The Plastic blade is not dead center on the motor and it wobbles a lot causing severe vibrations for the person who attempts to use this productI also found that the motor does not have enough power to cut thru' simple grass as even a slight touch on the grass slows the motor down which makes it useless. The Blade may last few months as it does not seem to erode quickly but if you do the math the cost of the blade is still high close to $30 compared to Strings (less than $5) which you can buy and replace easily.Before using this I have used Homelite 13 inch. 4 Amp String Trimmer/Edger which is not sold on Amazon but in local hardware store for less than $30 dollars and had excellent results with it.I still feel that the idea of using ""string blade"" is best as you have virtually unlimited cutting power and you can easily sacrifice the string and keep going at the weeds and grass once you reload them.Sorry!

The Global Garden Friends' Ultimate Plant Clip is an interesting concept at its core. These are certainly fine clips for tomato plants, or for any other small plant in need of a stake, supposing there exists enough girth between the plant and stake to hold the clip in place, or if there is a lateral branch on which the clip may rest; otherwise, these smooth, plastic clips will not hesitate to slide down.These clips have inner dimensions of almost a half an inch across the short length, by barely over one inch across from tip to snap. Closing them is a snap, quite literally, and they open up inch a pinch, also, quite literally.I believe these add a bit of whimsy to any plant on which they can stay in place; the theme is spot on. However, function is of utmost importance, and without friction of some sort to hold a clip in place, an alternate solution oftentimes becomes necessary.I enjoy the clips, but their application is somewhat limited. I eagerly look forward to using these on my next crop of tomatoes, but this did nothing for my poor little Orchid. I recommend these clips for situations in which these will be able to maintain their posts, so to speak, supposing cost is no factor, keeping in mind that they are no replacement for traditional ties.

Use it a while then replace it with a new, sharp pair.  I use scissors for everything from paper and fabric to household projects.  I know I'm not supposed to grab a pair and cut thin wire or plastic clam shells, but I do and I'd guess most people do something similar.  Once you cut a thin wire with your regular scissors once, they never work properly again.Fiskars Ultimate Multi Purpose Scissors are different.  I've never used a pair of scissors that held up to any project without suffering before, but this model of Fiskars pulls it off.  The first thing I cut was a piece of corrugated cardboard.  I frequently trim cardboard packing boxes, which can be tedious and box cutters are not always the best option.  The cuts were smooth with this pair of Fiskars.  I then tested them on a variety of fabric weights from sheers to blanket fleece and woolens and they cut evenly and cleanly every time.  I cut twist ties and thin jewelry wire and found no damage to the scissors from the wire, as they cut paper without flinching afterwards. Obviously a wire cutter is still the better option, but it's good to know that an occasional misuse of these scissors will not damage them.They come apart for cleaning, which is a nice detail for household scissors.  The safety shield for the scissors is feature packed.  There is a built in sharpener which is easy to use.  I love the tape cutter which allowed me to easily and safely open a tightly taped shipping box without a box cutter.  I even appreciate the two tone color of the handles, which helps me locate the pair quickly amongst my other orange handled scissors.  However, I really don't need any other scissors anymore other than this pair and my good fabric shears.I don't know that the bottle opener was really necessary, considering how few bottles these days require an opener.  But it's there if I need it.Overall, I'm very happy with this pair of scissors.  I can't believe I never had a pair like this in the past.

This damage to the central nervous system can cause paralysis, convulsions, and death.""

I hope that if this works and if mice do eat it and go off elsewhere to die that they do indeed go outside.

A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B001JJCW0M,MyPenName,"[2, 2]","We live out in the country, so it is no surprise that we have mice - and at certain times of the year, LOTS of them. You can always tell when the population is high, because there will be increased amounts of droppings and bits of insulation etc just strewn about in odd places. The mice harbor in our attached garage and rummage up through the insulation and ultimately come into our kitchen cabinets and closets. Ugh, it is just GROSS.We have used countless glue traps, which we have to then go and round up and dispose of, a few different types of poison - pellets and blocks (which turn the mice feces blue btw) and when you use the poison you just don't know where and when the mice will die. So they are just rotting off somewhere - GROSS! If you do find them, then you have to scoop them up and dispose of them.There have been plenty of days through all these years of living here, that we would put out 10-15 of the glue traps.. We put them in closets, cupboards, drawers, and down in the closets in the garage... and the next day ALL the traps had mice stuck to them. Some of them would have 2 mice stuck since it seemed that sometimes another thoughtful little guy would come along to help the first one and end up stuck himself. The glue traps and poison aren't too expensive unless as in our case you have to buy them constantly. So, then buying something more like this Victor Multi Kill seems alot more economical, even though the price tag seems steep compared to a pack of glue traps.The Victor Multi Kill is SUCH a relief. It makes disposing of the mice so much easier.. no running around trying to remember where all the glue traps are and then seeing the little guys STILL ALIVE squeaking their heads off. No coming across random dead mice due to eating poison and dying in a hidden spot in the house. I have come across mouse bones and fur obviously months and months after they have died and it is not fun. The multi Kill is so nice to have. You just set it up, let it do it's thing and then empty after a few days or so. If you have a larger house and or multiple areas of infestation, it is definitely worth it to have more than 1 Multi Kill. In our case, one in our garage closets and one in the main house area would be ideal with possibly a 3rd unit under our kitchen cabinets where the cat food is stored. At this point though, we have only tried out this one unit so far, but will pick up at least 1 more unit when we have some extra money.It is obvious that the device works since we can see the dead mice when we empty it. I feel it is definitely worth the money in the long run if you have an on going problem or if you have a sudden outbreak of mice. For the most part, if you have them once, you will have them again when the weather changes. It just makes more sense for us to spend the money in a lump sum and use the device repeatedly, for years to come, without any headaches, than to spend a few dollars repeatedly (adding up to more than the lump sum over time) and have all the extra work to do with disposal, round up, etc.We have had no problems with the device. It seems solid enough and it definitely gets the job done. Once we get a second unit, I will be even more relieved. So far we have been alternating the location of the 1 unit between the garage closets, under the kitchen cabinet, and in a closet in our closet hall (a hall full of nothing but huge walk in closets). I would love to have enough units to just let them all sit and do their job, as opposed to moving it around every week or so.The Multi Kill is definitely worth it's price and I do recommend it if you have a mouse problem.",5.0,Works as described,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",9,2011,701,75,MultiKill,,multikill,

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0096Q19YU,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","First I must state that my 'for review' Tri-Kill hasn't killed or caught any mice yet. Our mouse-invasion season is usually October-November when field mice seek warmth and shelter in our basement which is a bad idea because they all end up caught.With that in mind, we developed a pretty good understanding of what works and what doesn't when it comes to mouse defense. The ultrasound deterrents, for example do not seem to work. Mouse traps do but mice are smart and it's unlikely you'll catch more than one mouse with the same trap placed at the same location and one trap rarely catches more than 2 or 3 even if you move it around the basement. What works with mice is 'variety' and a bait that's hard to resist and hard to get to, unless the mouse enters the trap. The Tri-Kill therefore adds to the 'variety' arsenal, which is a good thing and there's no way the mouse get get close to the bait - peanut butter - unless the mouse enters the trap, another plus. Now, will the Tri-Kill ever catch more than once mouse at a time? I am highly skeptical of that because, like I said, mice are smart and they learn fast so I can't imagine how mouse number 2 would ever try to get to the bait while mouse number 1 is dead or struggling but I will be happy to come back and update this review once I see 2 or 3 mice caught in the Tri-Kill.Finally, the makers claim that this is a no-touch design. Now, I don't know what the definition of 'no-touch' is but the trap has no floor so, whatever the mice do while dying (use imagination) is going to be left on the floor. It would be difficult to avoid touching the kill while disposing of it unless you wear gloves but then all traps could be called 'no touch'.Three stars, by the way, stand for 'It's OK'. I will improve my rating once I see actual mice being caught.",3.0,Mouse Hotel - vacancy,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",4,2013,335,45,Tri-Kill,effectiveness,tri-kill,effectiveness
A14EPTYN50XSZV,B00G8R2JWG,Someone Else,"[1, 1]","Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet.",2.0,Updated Review.

I have tried several times (unsuccessfully) to reseed, overseed--pretty much everything short of actually having the whole thing ripped out and rototilled (if it were my lawn, and not my landlady's, I would). Because the dirt is so hard-packed and resists absorbing water, I got it in my head that aeration was the key. (My neighbor the gardener has a big machine, but I wanted to do this myself. I'm frugal like that.) I looked at several models and types at the local home stores, and finally decided to order this one. (In the interim, I ordered and tried theClean Air Distributing FLA1K20 Lawn Aerating Shoes. Let's call that an assistive device.

A3006WHOAYJRLI,B001AZJK46,Poogy,"[11, 13]","Several reviewers have reported problems with this trap, such as the trap not being strong enough to actually kill the rat.  I wonder how many times this happened to each of these reviewers before they concluded the trap doesn't work properly.  No trap works perfectly every time, but I've had a lot of experience with rat traps, and I can assure you this one works better than most.I've deployed six different types of traps: two types of glue traps, the old standby classic by Victor, a knock-off of the Victor, an elaborate and beautifully designed, Japanese-made cage to trap them alive, a second kind of live trap, and the Tomcat.  I've caught quite a few rats, so I can claim a little expertise on this subject.As I said, no trap will work perfectly every time in every situation, or they wouldn't have invented so many different types--we'd all just use the classic wood-and-metal type, which doesn't cost very much, and be happy and rat-free.  Each has its purpose--except for some that in my experience don't work: I haven't caught a single rat in the cheap Victor-type knock-off.  In all of the others, I have, but the Tomcat has been the most successful.  So I assure you, it does work, at least when I've use peanut butter as bait.Second, it it easy to set.  No need for worries about getting your fingers caught (and some of these traps can inflict some real pain). Once the trap is cocked open, it stays open; you don't have to be super-careful every time you get within two feet of it for fear it's going to snap.  The bait is inserted into a removable little tube, so you can take the tube out, put in the bait, put it back in without setting the trap, or even while the trap is already set, without a problem.Third, being plastic, it doesn't rot or get very rusty outside; the Victors do both eventually. You can even wash it once in a while, which is probably a good idea if you catch rats in it. (There's a spring in the Tomcat that does rust, but very slowly.)Fourth, it's reasonably priced, and unlike glue traps, it's endlessly reusable, doesn't catch any and all living things (bugs, frogs, roaches, lizards, whatever) that may wander across it, or present you with a glued living rat you have to get rid of.I did have one rat that got caught by the leg, and it was not a happy situation, least of all for the rat, which I put out of its misery.  But the same thing happens with every kind of snap trap once in a while.

Programming mode is very limited. The minimum time period you can set it up for is every 6 hours. It has to be exactly 6 hours apart.  My first timer gives me full control over when the waterings occur.  For example, I do not want to water in the middle of the night as might promote root rot.

I am attaching a photo which shows my set up.The house spigot has a Y to which the first timer (the timer that I like better by DIG) and a short utility hose is attached.The short utility hose has another Y which is attached to this timer, the second end of the Y goes to a garden hose.Both timers are connected to 1/4 tubing (via various fittings such as pressure regulator, hose-to-tube adapter, filter, backup flow controller) that waters my plants via a drip irrigation system.  The second Y and timer are placed on an old planter to hold them off the ground.  All connections are made with the aid of Teflon tape.  This set up works very well - no leaks, easy to get to all the switches.  The use of a short utility hose allowed me to expand the system in a way I could not fit on one spigot and without throwing away the original timer that I really like.The Orbit timer with the exception of the programming shortcoming described earlier works well.  If you plan to water once a day, this is a perfect timer.  If you wanted a more complex watering schedule this is not the best option.7/30/11Less than a month after the initial installation I noticed that my hydrangea (watered by this timer) is looking a bit wilted.

This trap humanely captures all of them, and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured.  The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely.

AVBLGXSWRN666,B000H1Y4EK,S. Jentsch,"[3, 3]","I put off getting a leaf blower for years, not wanting yet another tool in the garage if it would just take up space more often than it was used. I finally broke down last fall and picked up this model at Sears on sale, figuring that it would be useful for mulching leaves and it would beat using my lawn mower to blow the grass off the driveway and road after mowing (which works better than you might think).I knew that I didn't want a wimpy blower, so I researched models for the most CFM and the best reviews for durability and performance. I knew that I wanted something with a metal impeller for mulching, as plastic impellers just didn't seem up to task, and a variable speed control was also important. I also wanted something with a decent warranty in case I had any troubles. That research led me to this model. It's a popular model in sale ads, so if you keep your eyes open, you can get it for less than sixty.I would have been quite happy to buy this unit here on Amazon, but Sears had it for the better price, and with some things, it's also nice to be able to walk into a store and pick it out. You also have a little easier time returning/exchanging it if there is an issue.That turned out to be a good choice, as I ran into trouble on the third time I used it. The variable speed controller malfunctioned, and it became the equivalent of an on/off button, as it was either off or on at full speed.After considering whether to call Toro to get it fixed/replaced under warranty, I figured I would give Sears a chance to take care of that for me. I brought everything in (including the box) with my receipt from two months previous, and they allowed me to exchange it for a brand new model off the shelf. That's the kind of customer service that keeps brick and mortar stores relevant!I've been using that replacement for nearly a year, and I've had no troubles with it, so I'm willing to chalk up that first unit to a random part failure and not an indictment of the product in general. It is something to keep in mind when you are selecting where to purchase such an item, however.From a performance standpoint, I'm very happy with how it functions as a blower. It makes easy work out of blowing the grass clippings back onto the lawn, and I even use it to sweep across clumped grass so that it doesn't dry in a large mass and kill the lawn beneath. There's a large volume of air that comes out of the nozzle at the highest speed setting, and this means that there's a large volume of air being sucked into the intake at the bottom. Be sure to keep loose clothing away from this inlet!Converting to vacuum operation is quite easy, and it works very well. The bag could be another color besides white, as mulched leaves will discolor the bag pretty quickly. If the leaves that you are cleaning up are even a little wet, that moisture is going to stain the bag and it's not going to look out-of-the-box new ever again. Not a big deal to most of us, but something to keep in mind and something for Toro to consider when sourcing this bag in the future.Overall, I'm very happy with this power tool. It does everything I expect it to do, and it's definitely much lighter than a gas-operated equivalent. While it does produce a fair bit of noise due to its funtion, it's not so annoying that I feel like I need earplugs when using it.

Cuts smaller stumps right to ground level-read my full review.  My neighbor, who never takes care of his property, has a poorly maintained pine.  I recently had a tree trimmer slice the branches on my side.  Now the best part.  I used a pressure washer to expose the large roots on my side.  I then used the lopper to cut out 6 inch sections from all those roots.  The main artery on my side-gone. You can do this becuse the non-cutting side of the lopper allows you to get under the root, and the chain side then slices it apart.  Not a possible task with any other tool.  My axe bounced off the large roots.  I cleaned and oiled the chain well after doing this task.  Love my lopper.  Original review below.The kit is a much better value.  Get it instead while it's available. I posted this review on the kit page. Just type lopper kit, on the Amazon search page.What's in the kit?, May 16, 2008By  P. Stein ""Bengals Fan"" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI just received my lopper today. I was very surprised and pleased with the kit. It contains: Black and Decker workgloves, safety glasses, a long outdoor extension cord, and a very high quality bag. I was expecting a cheap cloth bag. This looks like a high quality canvas or nylon denier bag with the Black and Decker name. Bag is worth $20-25. 50 ft 16 Gauge extension-$8, glasses and gloves - $5.00. Why would anyone buy the Lopper itself, instead of the kit? Go to the Lopper kit-sold on Amazon. Must be an item specially made for Amazon. Doesn't exist elsewhere. Kit is not well described in description. One extra point on the bag. It is so useful for organizing tools and keeping them clean, I wanted to buy more and googled it. Apparently it's not available separately. It is on EBAY, but bags are smaller and shipping is high. Makes this kit an especially good value.I have quite a few low growing shrubs I needed to remove. They are very mature and thick. The woody thick stems are too low and bunched for a chain saw, and my hand lopper wore me out. This is a perfect tool for this use. As others have commented, lube system is stupid. It is gravity fed, so you need to hold the jaws toward the ground and slowly add oil. I did that, but also generously hand (paper towel) oiled the chain and bar before each use, as you do for manual oiled chainsaws. Buy a quart of chainsaw bar oil. Lopper works great for intended purpose. Doesn't replace a hedge cutter. Works best for thicker (1/2 - 4 inch wood).  I just used it to remove 6 large mature shrubs.  They were 6 inches thick at the base, and I cut them going around in a circle.  Worked great. The very thin woody stems kept catching in the Lopper, but I could keep cutting, and removed them after the cutting. Use a Hedge trimmer on the thin stems, before you get to the lopper sized stems. You really need separate tools for each task. I have this lopper, a hedge trimmer, an electric chain saw, a gas chain saw, and a Fiskar pruner. Stay away from tools that claim to do it all. My preferred order of use is: 1. Hedge trimmer when possible-for speed and safety. 2. Lopper (for safety). 3. Electric chainsaw (for safety. 4. Gas chain saw (when all else fails).This is one of the most useful items I have ever purchased. I have been using it constantly since receiving it.

It works best in direct sunlight, but it also worked for me on partly cloudy days.The built-in power port has connectors for charging 12V devices (Sherpa and others) and USB devices (cellphones and others).  You will need to supply the USB cables to connect your USB devices.The literature says that the panel will charge cellphones,  iPods, and tablets.  It works well with my Android smartphone; however, an iPod Touch (4th gen) delivered a message that the solar panel was incompatible, and my Kindle Paperwhite (2nd gen) repeatedly froze after beginning to charge (requiring a full reboot to be operational again after each attempt).  So I would recommend using the NOMAD 7 with care (stay with the newly connected device) until you find out which of your devices are completely compatible.  But it's still a great piece of equipment to have on hand for charging cellphones in emergency situations.",5.0,Valuable Addition to Earthquake Preparedness Kit,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",12,2013,260,75,NOMAD7,compatibility,nomad7,compatibility

It also provides a bit of shelter for the birds when they are eating.

That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that.

I wasn't completely impressed with the smallerPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder, in large part because of the absence of perches.  But this one fits the bill.  Fillup is a little easier with the large-mouthed top (you've still got to be careful walking with it), and cleanup is simplified by the snap-apart design.  The perches are there and the overall appearance (at least by human standards) is more attractive than the previous large model with its more cylindrical shape.But of course the real proof is the birds.  In my experience the birds tend to stay away from a new feeder for a day or two.  Perhaps they're watching to make sure it doesn't turn into a cat or something.  But not with this one.  As soon as the birds were out and about, they were on this one.  Perhaps it's the bright white 'flowers'.

It was priced better than anywhere else so I decided to give it a try.It comes fully assembled and ready to go. A few other tumblers I read about require a great deal of assembly, including numerous screws that eventual rust or break. This product consists of a large bin and the base. You can set it up out of the box in less than a minute! The barrel does have some weight to it, roughly around 30 pounds empty.I have read a few reviews about the hole being too small to fit a shovel or other instruments in. I have not had this problem at all. I was able to transfer compost from my geobin piles into the tumbler with no problem whatsoever.My suggestion is to only fill the container half or 3/4 of the way. Empty it seems pretty heavy, but would quickly become unmanagable the more materials you put in it. I decided to put the tumbler next to my garden so it could get more sun. I rolled it from the compost piles to the garden. It wasn't the easiest thing to roll, but it did eventually make it (after knocking me in the shins a few times, ouch!) Even with it being only 1/2 full, this was quite a chore.The holes in the bin seem like they are a decent size. They are not large enough to allow scraps to fall out, but small enough to allow some rain water in. It seems to be the perfect size without oversaturating the compost materials.I would buy this product again in a heart beat.

A deep dent on the bottom of the box caused me some concern, which was allayed when I saw the Masonite squares within the box, reinforcing each corner - nothing within was damaged.The table arrived dent-free. However, while unpacking the table from the box, sheet metal screws were raining down on me. I thought that the plastic bag holding the hardware must have had a hole in it, but NO -- these were screws that were holding the resin planks to the metal bars(under the table) running perpendicular to the table. And since the planks are made of resin and the sheet metal screws are screwed directly into the planks, some screws had come loose and fallen out, some to the point of almost losing their ""grip"" in these resin planks. THIS will impact the longevity of this table for sure. I believe a threaded insert in the resin and then a round headed bolt with a Phillips slot-head screwed through the metal bars, and then into that threaded insert would have been much much sturdier and better in the long-term. So, Three Stars for this -- had the slats been more securely fastened, I would have initially given this table Four Stars.That being said, the table is handsome - and I am glad I have a 14 foot long balcony -- as this table is large -- wicker woven on a steel structure, surrounding faux wood planks. It is heavy -- and large enough to hold some plants as decor while still leaving plenty of room for food, be it potluck or pizza. The hole in the middle of the table -- for the umbrella -- is a great touch. The FOUR wicker-on-steel table legs (which I have yet to assemble onto the table) seem heavy enough to hold the table up, but I think SIX legs might be better than four -- more needs to be said about this, and once I attach the legs, I will be better able to judge this. I DO wonder if, when I add the patio umbrella (also sold by Strathmore Furniture), should a gust of wind twist it to and fro (despite the weighted base) would that make this Four-legged table fall over? To be determined, at a later date (mid-late Spring)......One plank seems to be longer than the other -- It is not flush with the edge of the table -- I took it apart and repositioned it to make it sit flush with all the others.I also keep a big heavy tarp nearby, to cover the table against inclement weather, as per the initial instructions. The biggest test, other than the screws' ability to retain their grip on the planks long-term, will be in the summer with its significant heat and humidity, and how THAT affects the table (warping? Mildew?).UPDATE-- Summertime!! The heat and humidity have been pretty bad for about 2 weeks. Things are better now. I have two fans on my balcony -- one of which is trained on the underside of this table. It helps.

This Goal Zero Nomad 7 has become one of my instant favorites.  The craftsmanship and attention to detail are excellent.  The case has nine hanging loops, which provides a lot of options if you're using it while camping, and the case seals with a magnetic closure, which I find more convenient and less bulky than velcro.The Nomad 7 has two standard panels, each about the size of a half sheet of notebook paper, so it's about the size of a pad of paper fully opened.  It has three different outputs on the back:  A USB port, a dedicated cable to feed into a Guide 10 battery charger, and a 12v DC female socket (i.e., a ""cigarette lighter"" socket like in your car).  The 12v DC out is not included on any of my other portable solar panels -- it's a nice addition.  The panel also has an input to chain it to other Nomads.  The output/input connections are all in a single block, which is covered by a zippered mesh pouch on the back of the panel so you can keep all of your charging cables neatly stored with the panel.  The port labels are printed right on the case so you can't lose them -- a handy and smart detail.The Nomad 7 can charge some devices (like my phone) directly, but it won't charge my iPad directly.  To charge an iPad, you need to use the Nomad 7 to charge a battery pack (Goal Zero recommends the Guide 10 battery charger; I use an Anker 5V/2A external battery, which doesn't have removable batteries but is smaller and works great), then dump the charge from the external battery pack to your iPad.  This isn't just because the Nomad 7 doesn't pump out enough power, it's also because the iPad doesn't like power that fades in and out, which happens frequently as clouds cross the sun.  My Instapark 10w solar panel also needs an intermediate battery to charge my iPad reliably, even though the 10w panel is sufficient to charge the iPad directly on a completely clear, sunny day when the panel output doesn't fluctuate.Because it has two panels instead of three, the Nomad 7 is a bit smaller and lighter than the Instapark, and the 7w output seems to charge up an external battery pack very quickly.

Larger birds will choose a bird bath, everytime. I liked this concept as a cleaner water option that required less attention than a bird bath which dirties easily.I like that the bottle itself is small, requiring it to be filled more frequently. This helps insure it is refilled with fresh water and not growing green slime. Which, I also put a dash of apple cider vinegar in the waterers to help keep things from getting funky. The smaller bottle also isn't too heavy when filled. It's still plenty easy to lift to a feeding station.

In the hot smoke function, which cooks and smokes food at the same time - probably the most-used function - simply put a few smoking chips into a cup, cover the cup, pour in 1/2 cup water, layer the seasoned food onto the stacking racks, seal the cooker, set the time, and press ""Start.""  It really is that simple.  So far, I've cooked pork tenderloin, chicken drumsticks, and, using the cold smoke function, a salmon fillet. To my knowledge, this is the only stovetop appliance that will cold smoke food.  All the results were perfectly satisfactory.  This could be fun, so my next projects will be smoked hardboiled eggs, and smoked cheese.Details:  I didn't have any chips, so I've used the finely chopped wood chips I purchased for a Cameron stovetop smoker.  These worked fine, using about 1 tablespoon each time.  I followed the suggested times in the instruction booklet, except for the salmon.  I wanted smoked, lightly cooked salmon to place on a salad platter, and the instructed time would have produced a flakey fish suitable for mixing into pates.Reality checks:  While the pressure smoker does smoke food much faster than traditional outdoor smoking, the process is not nearly as fast as pressure cooking in a traditional pressure cooker.  The Emson instructions say to cook chicken pieces for 30 minutes, which produced a slightly overcooked, but tasty dinner.  A traditional pressure cooker takes ten minutes to cook chicken parts.  It may be possible to match the faster results by a traditional cooking method in the Emson smoker, omitting the chips, but the residual smoke odor would discourage me from cooking any recipe other than smoked food.More reality:  The capacity of the cooker is limited to approximately the amount of food for three or four people even with the layering of the racks.  But, the process is quick, so one could repeat the process for a bigger crowd.  The smoke odor fills the room; it remained for over a day, even though I am able to leave a door open to outside and ran the kitchen exhaust fan directly above the cooker while I was using it.  I washed the cooker and am storing it in the garage, but I still smell the smoke when I pass it, several days later.  The safety instructions do not spell out clearly enough the risk of burning oneself.  The user must pull off the pressure regulator to release the steam.  This sends steam shooting out.  I tried it first with a thick hot pad to protect my hand and quickly pulled back as the pad became saturated with steam.  I used a silicone mitt to remove the regulator with good results.  I still came away with my hair and clothes smelling like smoke.All in all, it's a well-made product that delivers as promised.",4.0,Speedy smoked food,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",11,2011,505,75,smoker,odor,smoker,odor

Additionally I had to modify the Multi-catch trap as it would have easily released any entrapped mouse with a simple nose press on the upper lid...The Havaheart trap looked weak and appeared difficult to set, I seriously had doubts initially.  I admit I played with the trap awhile and made a number of minor adjustments to the trap before baiting it with a piece of Granola Bar which I ""glued"" to the bait table with a nice chunk of peanut butter.  Once baited, I found a quiet closet in which Bo Jangles had previously been spotted and set it in the middle of the closet floor. AFTER setting the trap in place and being sure this was ""the place"" did I attempt to actually set the previously baited trap.I gave this Havahart trap a 5 star rating despite the written instructions being less than ideal since it caught our lil friend in less than a week.  Just play with the trap awhile and understand how it works before relying on it to catch your mice.  Also understand that it may need a few minor adjustments due to being bounced around in shipping.I wish to thank the Reviewer who provided sane advice for a wise method for releasing the trapped mouse.  As a reminder, when releasing the mouse open the door that is AWAY from you!!  In our case, I took the trap to a local field along with a reliable stick.  I set the trap in the field and used the stick to gently remove the door lock of the door AWAY from me thereby allowing the mouse to nose his way through door.  Using the stick I had to gently move the trap over on the side to allow the mouse an easier time of releasing itself from the trap but at least I didn't have a mouse running up my coat sleeve!! ;-)",5.0,IT WORKED!!!!

A3R19YKNL641X3,B00JEHI28C,"Thomas Duff ""Duffbert""","[1, 2]","I got the chance to try out the TeiKis BBQ grill mat and metal skewers this weekend, and they worked out better than I expected. Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I'm not sure how much I'll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free",4.0,"For a BBQ novice, this worked out pretty well...",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",6,2014,325,75,GrillMat,Cleaning,grillmat,cleaning

The metal pan base appears to be galvanized, which means it is coated with a layer of zinc to prevent rusting.  If so, that zinc will leach into the water and is toxic to birds.  I returned mine for this reason. Feeders containing copper should also be avoided, since copper toxicity is also problem for birds.  Also avoid hummingbird food containing red dye, which is associated with birth defects.  (Instead just use a 1:4 mixture of sugar to unsoftened water; which is the same thing, without the harmful dye).  Since you probably don't intend to harm the birds you are trying to help, I would advise choosing different products.  If you have already purchased these products, I would advise returning them or just throwing them away.  You won't see the dead hummingbirds, new ones will keep coming to the feeder, but you may be killing them off without realizing it.

Gilmour used to be very good quality, but not anymore. Apparently most everyone has gone to China and the quality of these valves has really gone downhill, but not the price they charge you. This valve is really cheap and can't take much pressure and it got  a pin hole leak in the valve after about 2 years and I foolishly  replaced it with another one, to have it blow it out six months later as it was the only Y valve the HW had and I needed another one ASAP. I use quite a few Y valves/hose splitters  and 4 way splitters, so the 'search' was on to find something better.Here is how I rate the valves now after ordering them and studying them and using them.BEST1. Camco-Y  ball Valve/ hose spliter. Made in the USA, solid , solid brass with amazing full sized ball valves. High flow. Designed to also fit RV. Commercial grade valve! Hands down winner and same price as the Gilmour and made in the USA. Available on Amazon. This is superb valve.2. Achla Designs. Made in Taiwan but very solid and heavy. For commercial use. Available on Amazon. This is a great valve.3. Orbit Y ball Valve /splitter - Much thicker than Gilmour valve. And much cheaper. Made in China. Available on Amazon. This is a pretty good valve.4. Nelson Y ball valve/splitter-Nelson went to China not to long ago. Current valves are very lightweight and not suitable for commercial use. Orbit splitters are heavier and better made. Available on Amazon. This is acceptable if you turn the Hose bibb off and have lower pressure water lines.5 Melnor, more cheap made in China stuff, quality is not as good as Nelson made in China stuff largely as Nelson is has better finish quality. Available on Amazon. This is similar to the Nelson.6. Ray Padula- More made in China that is suitable for gardening but not commercial use. All of Rays Products are made in China and are very expensive. He's kind of what is wrong with the USA, marketing hype and advertising then off-shoring to sweat shops and delivering poor quality and hoping you're 'dumb' as he rolls in the money . Ray should have gone to college to learn mechanical engineer and manufacturing and learned what it means to be an American manufacturer. Give a 'lifetime' guarantee to try and convince you its worth the time to drive and pick up a new valve. His prices indicate he expects 2.5 valves to fail in your lifetime. Buy Camco and pay once and less and get made in the USA!!! Let Ray move to China, the Chinese want made in the USA for their own gardens.WORST---------------------------------------I wish someone with an engineering background or industrial background would write these reviews, but the made in China crowd would not make as much money replacing their blown out valves.I don't know why DRAMM does not make a Y valve or Hose splitter or if they do, why Amazon does not carry it.  Amazon carries some of their high quality nozzles and hose disconnects that are made in the USA and high quality.  DRAMM is the best when it comes to brass. Camco is the next best quality you're going to find.Stay away from that Made in China stuff, we send them fake money, with Pictures of dead Presidents and they send us fake valves that break down.

Each cube is attached to at least three other cubes by the plastic cut that surrounds each cube. Also, each cube has a aluminum foil on top of it to seal the flammable material in the plastic cup.The first challenge is how to separate them. They do not just pull apart. I cut mine with a scissors, which resulted in small pieces of the flammable material all over my counter. Then I wondered, do I remove the foil? Is the plastic cup flammable? There are no answers to these questions on the packaging.That precedes the question of how to ignite the cubes once charcoal has been stacked on top of them. There are three answers to that question, a long fireplace match, a propane torch or charcoal lighter fluid.  My choice was the latter and viola, instant flames, and assumed Weber lighter cube ignition.What seems simple when reading the sales literature is in fact, not simple at all. And if you are using a chimney starter to light your charcoal, the problem will be magnified, although you could probably put charcoal in the chimney, hold it over your head to be able to see the cubes and ignite them with a butane lighter.

Over the past few years I've begun using black plastic sheeting as a mulch to cover the beds and I'm a complete convert: black plastic mulch heats the soil, retains moisture and, most importantly, it makes weeding a thing of the past, except... Except that when it comes to certain crops, like onions, it's really not efficient. It's simply too big a chore to cut slits for 200-300 baby onion plants and even if you do, weeds will grow up *right next* to the onion plant. Last year I had a horrific weeding problem in my onion bed (I devoted one 4x12' bed to just onions); some awful insidious grasses just took over and made weeding a torturous chore and kept the size of the yield to a bare minimum. Weeds robbed all of the nitrogen and other nutrients in the soil and really stunted the growth.I decided this year to try a pre-emergent weed killer, but being the organic sort of person I am, I certainly wasn't going to pump Preen or some other awful crap into my food beds. I'd been reading about the benefits of corn gluten meal (though there is considerable online debate about its effectiveness) and decided this was the year I would try it. What the heck; if it works, a miracle, if not, I'm not worse off than last year (and next year I'd have to figure out a way to use the plastic with onions). Then the Amazon Vine Program offered me, like a miracle, a bag of this corn gluten meal. Perfect timing. So last week I took what was a strawberry bed for the past few years, dug up all the strawberry plants, churned in 120 lbs of composted manure and let it sit for a few days. Then I added this corn gluten meal and raked it in and watered it gently per the instructions. Interestingly, I had read many times that timing is everything with corn gluten and that the best time to put it into the soil is just as the forsythia are budding--and that's just what I did (I'm in zone 6 in Connecticut). I'm letting the corn sit for a few days before I plant the onion plants. By the way, you can't use this product with seeds because obviously it will not allow them to ""emerge."" It is *only* useful with seedlings and the bag says it's perfectly safe for seedlings.Of course, I can't yet tell you if it works or not because it's not warm enough for the weeds to really be kicking in. But I'm following the instructions carefully, have done everything I think is required and now I'm just waiting. (There are time constraints on Vine reviews otherwise I would have waited to post this.) But I *will* update this in about two weeks (early May) to see if it really is controlling weeds. I'm kind of excited to see if this works, because if it does, I may use it in other beds and stop buying as much plastic. I don't mind using the plastic, but again, for some crops, it's quite a pain. So, update coming soon. I hope this works!Update 4/27: OK, about a week, so far no signs of weeds. But I planted 200 onions today, so fingers crossed.Update 5/02: Kind of impressed.

That is a big plus for me because I am basically lazy and these allow me to make shorter work of lawn jobs.I do not get many leaves, but I am forever cutting back bushes and trimming palm fronds. Where these have proven to be perfect is I have an interesting population of snakes in my yard as do many Floridians. My visitors include a coral snake that is not aggressive, but one that I do not want to bite me when I am scooping up debris, fronds and shrub trimmings. And there is always a pygmy rattlesnake or two in the yard. These scoops put some distance between my hands and inquiring fangs, and I suspect that when my yard guests see this looming near them when I am scooping up stuff they quickly move somewhere else.Seriously, these are easy to use and can pick up surprisingly large amounts of debris. It's easy to clean with a hose, and the pair nestles for easy storage, In fact, there is a hanging loop incorporated into the design for maximum convenience.This ships with a thin fabric bag with a logo. It is not something that would work for long term storage, but it certainly handy for other, unrelated uses. But the scoops are the best yard tool that I have come across in a long time.

Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4"" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.

Previously I went to a battery operated string trimmer after I gave up on my gas unit after two paid service calls that fixed it so it would start for 3 weeks.  When the batteries died after two years I tried the Hitachi based upon reviews and the 7 year warranty.Like the trimmer, the blower starts every time, the second pull out of the box, first time each time since.  The air velocity is notably better and stronger than the neighbor's brand X and it's of course much more convenient than my previous corded electric version.  It easily moves leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips and slivers from chain sawing two large trees.Although there are only three pieces to assemble, assembly was difficult.  The end piece on the two piece nozzle is a tight fit and the nozzle to the motor housing is an equally tight fit.  It was a two person job and still difficult.  I would not want to have to disassemble and reassemble it for every use.5 stars because it's powerful and starts easily every time.Added after a year of use.  Still strong and always starts.  If you're right handed, you have to hold it away from your body  or you'll block the air inlet.  If you're blowing a yard full of leaves, that can get tiresome.

It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain! I love that it came with several different fountain sprays. My favorite, is actually the shorter, standard type fountain fixture.I've not had trouble with the water being expelled from the bird bath as others have. Even when using the taller fountain fixtures. I love that it keeps the birdbath water circulating ~ keeps it cleaner for a lot longer! Mosquitoes aren't quite here yet, but this should help keep them at bay.This particular pump has little rubber suctions cups that should stick to a bird bath that is GLAZED (maybe painted). My birdbath is concrete and it doesn't stick (I didn't expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn't move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you'll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible. I'm fortunate enough to have a 6' PVC fence and perch that panel up leaning on one of the fence post caps and it's perfect!

The build quality has gone up quite a bit, and remember, my old one was going strong at seven years on the original batteries.  This one has far better balance and grips, and far more power than 2 additional watts would suggest.  Previously when switching into edger mode, I'd have to make 2-3 passes to cleanly edge my lawn.

So, if it wasn't obvious to you before when you happened to look at this model please allow me to point that out. And, that's the only difference - all other parts and functions are the same.I bought this latest model as a gift for a friend.  I own this model's immediate predecessor that does not have the LCD timer.  And, this is my second Weber Performer; the first was the original, all metal model, which I finally decided to replace after many years of service and countless grillings.Why not opt for the gas ignition? I've been using a chimney charcoal starter for many years since the gas ignition feature on my original Performer wore out and decided to just save $50 with this one.The 22.5"" Weber Kettle is the best charcoal grill for the money available today. It's simple to use and very versatile. It's big enough to have different cooking zones. Charcoal uses radiant heat to cook and direct grilling allows for extremely high heat to sear steaks and burgers. The grill's style also allows you to cook with indirect heat for chicken, ribs and other foods needing lower heat and longer time to cook just right. Of course, charcoal gives all your food a superior taste over a gas grill.The Performer just makes the Kettle so much better with a work table surface area, integrated tilt out charcoal storage bin, large storage rack beneath and it rolls / moves easier than a standard Kettle.Some useful tips if you buy the Performer:* Buy a Weber rotisserie insert for this grill. Absolutely fantastic accessory for making incredibly delicious, moist chicken, turkey, etc.* For grilling, I switched to the cast iron insert by Craycourt a couple years ago. Wonderful! They are relatively expensive, but once you've tried them you'll wonder why you didn't switch earlier.* There are so many great places to learn using your Weber.

To insert the bait, I wear disposable gloves and push the cardboard to the back of the device using a wooden paint stirrer.  Didn't I say that I'm squeamish?I have rats in my yard, outside.  Sometimes the seeds fallen from the bird feeders attract them.  They, too, must die.  Generally I rely on bait boxes which I fill with poisonous bait.

I rebaited the boxes and, sure enough, found a dead rat within a couple days.There are methods of dealing with the intelligence of rats, like allowing them to take the bait for a few days with the Rat Zapper turned off.  After they are used to eating the bait, you power the Rat Zapper and should find a dead rat.

First you have to set the trap.  This involves rolling a very tight rubber ring around the trap.  That's a pain and I ended up needing my son's help.  We tried tripping the trap and it tripped one time out of three attempts.  We placed the trap in a high mouse traffic zone.  It was located by plain old sticky boards.  The first two nights all the sticky boards had a mouse but not the nooski.  The third night, the nooski caught a mouse.  Kind of.  It actually ended up not around his neck but kind of around his head.  He made it a good distance.  We only found him because of the bright green ring.  I really hate mice and I will kill them to keep them out of my grain, chicken coops, and especially house.  But there is no way I can justify doing that to an animal.  I'll stick with using One Bite and sticky boards.",1.0,I am not sure if it could be more complicated,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",11,2012,240,20,Nooski,inhumane,nooski,inhumane
A1EH2S92FHWZRP,B00G8R2PS4,Just a guy,"[0, 0]","This is not a very good bird feeder.  First of all, the top has no latch to keep closed - it just pivots open.  Any squirrel can open this easily and just eat from the top.  Also, not clear from the photo - this is not a cylander.  It has a flat back for mounting on a wall or post (which is what the description says) - but the photo made this unclear.My big knock on this (only two stars) is because of the top mechanism.",2.0,flat back and top is too easy for squirrels to open,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",3,2014,83,25,feeder,latch,feeder,latch

As they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks nor can you expect someone to change how they have used garden hoses all their lives. You are supposed to follow a specific method for initially operating the hose. Another factor in rating it a 1 is there is no manufacturer contact information included with the hose. None on the box and none in the directions. I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad, you are simply out of luck. Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water. Makes me wonder what is leaching out from this hose into the water and worry also about pets or animals drinking water that came out of this hose. The better option is a 50' coiled hose which we have two of. I bought two very good quality coiled hoses and have been using them for 3 seasons now without any problems. Overall I think these hoses are a useless gimmick.",1.0,A gimmick hose,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",4,2014,194,15,hose,restrictions,hose,restrictions
